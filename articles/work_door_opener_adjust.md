# How to adjust the door opener

1. Locate the door opener.



2. Note the swing speed and the latch speed. Swing speed is how fast the door moves when it's very open, and latch speed is how fast the door moves when it is almost closing.



3. Now grab a 1/8 inch hex driver.



4. If you want to adjust the latch speed, look at the left of the door opener for the top hole.



5. If you want to adjust the swing speed, look at the left of the door opener for the bottom hole.



6. To slow down the speed, move the hex driver away from you. To increase the speed, move the hex driver towards you.



7. Check the door speed, and make any more adjustments as needed.
