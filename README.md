# away_from_home

Away from home is a React Native project that I'm making for my mom specifically. Ever since I was a little child I helped out with doing various chores around the house but also at my mom's restaurant. But since I'm a college student, there's a lot less that I'm able to do since I'm not physically there, and my schedule only keeps me busier and busier so it's also harder for me to just video call about an issue.

So this app is meant to contain a collection of tutorials of things I've learned to work with/fix while I'm not back home. Especially since my mother isn't super fluent with English, I basically end up translating all the instruction manuals into pictures and videos in Chinese so that she and the rest of my family can understand my tutorials.

Examples include doing things like re-programming the garage door opener in our house or resetting the padlock passwords and whatnot. Other tutorials may also include things like paying bills online or troubleshooting wifi issues. So this is essentially like a private wiki-how custom tailored for my family.

## Future Features

Eventually I want to also expand this into a secure messanging app so that if there's any sensitive mail documents that I need to translate for my family, they can just send it to me over this app without any security compromises that other convenient messaging software may have. It also avoids the privacy issues with using other messaging services.

The other thing I need to figure out in the meanwhile is a backend for storing tutorials and other content in a format that's not hard-coded into the React app, and that'll also help me start diving into backend development and open up my skill-set and knowledge.

And once I get that figured out, hopefully I'll make a way for other people to make tutorials and share them either through the app or a website that connects to the backend too, and making tutorials will now be in the user's abilities rather than just the developer's abilities.
